# Matchstick
This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks. There is a certain number of matchstick lines. The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks. The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.
### Usage:
      make re &&
      ./matchstick -h
      ./matchstick nbr1 nbr2
